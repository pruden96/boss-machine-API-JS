# Boss Machine

## Project Overview

This project is part of Codecademy's back-end career path. All development is located on the folder "server".

## Implementation Details

#### Routes Required

- `/api/minions`
  - GET /api/minions to get an array of all minions.
  - POST /api/minions to create a new minion and save it to the database.
  - GET /api/minions/:minionId to get a single minion by id.
  - PUT /api/minions/:minionId to update a single minion by id.
  - DELETE /api/minions/:minionId to delete a single minion by id.
- `/api/ideas`
  - GET /api/ideas to get an array of all ideas.
  - POST /api/ideas to create a new idea and save it to the database.
  - GET /api/ideas/:ideaId to get a single idea by id.
  - PUT /api/ideas/:ideaId to update a single idea by id.
  - DELETE /api/ideas/:ideaId to delete a single idea by id.
- `/api/meetings`
  - GET /api/meetings to get an array of all meetings.
  - POST /api/meetings to create a new meeting and save it to the database.
  - DELETE /api/meetings to delete _all_ meetings from the database.

For all `/api/minions` and `/api/ideas routes`, any POST or PUT requests will send their new/updated resources in the request body. POST request bodies will not have an `id` property, you will have to set it based on the next id in sequence.

For `/api/meetings` POST route, no request body is necessary, as meetings are generated automatically by the server upon request. Use the provided `createMeeting` function exported from **db.js** to create a new meeting object.

### Working with the 'Database'

The **server/db.js** file exports helper functions for working with the database arrays. The goal of this project is for you to focus on Express routes and not worry about how the database works under the hood. These functions always take at least one argument, and the first argument is always a string representing the name of the database model: `'minions'`, `'ideas'`, `'meetings'`, or `'work'`.

`getAllFromDatabase`:

- Takes only the single argument for model name. Returns the array of elements in the database or `null` if an invalid argument is supplied

`getFromDatabaseById`:

- Takes the model name argument and a second string argument representing the unique ID of the element. Returns the instance with valid inputs and `null` with an invalid id.

`addToDatabase`:

- Takes the model name argument and a second argument which is an object with the key-value pairs of the new instance. `addToDatabase` handles assigning `.id` properties to the instances. It does not check to make sure that valid inputs are supplied, so you will have to add those checks to your routes if necessary. `addToDatabase` will return the newly-created instance from the database. This function will validate the schema of the instance to create and throw an error if it is invalid.

`updateInstanceInDatabase`:

- Takes the model name argument and a second argument which is an object representing an updated instance. The instance provided must have a valid `.id` property which will be used to match. `updateInstanceInDatabase` will return the updated instance in the database or `null` with invalid inputs. This function will validate the schema of the updated instance and throw an error if it is invalid.

`deleteFromDatabasebyId`:

- Takes the model name argument and a second string argument representing the unique ID of the element to delete. Returns `true` if the delete occurs properly and `false` if the element is not found.

`deleteAllFromDatabase`:

- Takes only the single argument for model name. Deletes all elements from the proper model and returns a new, empty array. You will only need to use this function for a /api/meetings route.

#### Schemas

- Minion:
  - id: string
  - name: string
  - title: string
  - salary: number
- Idea
  - id: string
  - name: string
  - description: string
  - numWeeks: number
  - weeklyRevenue: number
- Meeting
  - time: string
  - date: JS `Date` object
  - day: string
  - note: string

Take note that many values that could be numbers are in fact strings. Since we are writing an API, we can't trust that data is always provided by a client. You may need to transform between String and Number JavaScript types in order to provide full functionality in your API.

### Custom Middleware

- You will create a custom middleware function `checkMillionDollarIdea` that will come in handy in some /api/ideas routes. Write this function in the **server/checkMillionDollarIdea.js** file. This function will make sure that any new or updated ideas are still worth at least one million dollars! The total value of an idea is the product of its `numWeeks` and `weeklyRevenue` properties.

### Bonus

Implementing routes to allow bosses to add and remove work from their minions' backlogs.

Schema:

- Work:
  - id: string
  - title: string
  - description: string
  - hours: number
  - minionId: string

Routes required:

- GET /api/minions/:minionId/work to get an array of all work for the specified minon.
- POST /api/minions/:minionId/work to create a new work object and save it to the database.
- PUT /api/minions/:minionId/work/:workId to update a single work by id.
- DELETE /api/minions/:minionId/work/:workId to delete a single work by id.

## Testing

Run the `mocha` command in the terminal from your project root directory.
